        <h2 class="title">Making of Denial Bagel</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Never have I ever imagined I would on eday build a website. Growing up I had never been sharp with
            technology. I never passed one single coding class, and had zero interest in anything code related.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Until...I injured myself in a backpacking trip and had to stay home and rest for a few months. (read about
            my accident here). With the newly acquired free time, the idea occured to me.

        <p class="p3">
            What started as a fleeting thought stayed in the back of my head, marinated for a few days until I decided
            to give it a go. For one week I went through a 5 hour HTML and CSS tutorial, hence the making of this
            website.

            I can't thank my good friend, Walter Augustine enough. Being a developer himself, he didn't mind spending
            time coding with me outside of his work hour. Enduring my messy codes and dumb questions, helping me debug
            and teaching me tips and tricks that he acquired from coding full time for almost 10 years.
