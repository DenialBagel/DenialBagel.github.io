Video diary
</p>
<p>
    I was doing a journaling exercise, and the idea suddenly occured to me that I can shoot a video of me talking about my day in Spanish. 
</p><p>
So that's what I did. I shot a 7 minute video, using different corners of my bedroom, playing with different lighting. It turned out quite lovely. Watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/p1ngKadnOg4">here</a>. Later, I went on to making more videos regularly.

    <p>I try writing in Spanish as much as I can, because writing is a very good exercise to train my ability to think in Spanish. Read my entries <a href="/blog/tag/espanol/index.html">here.</a> </p>

    <p>I started teaching Cantonese online since April 2025. This journey, although still in its infancy, has been incredibly fruitful. I have had the privilege of teaching students from all over the world, from toddlers to working adults. </p> <p>In addition to private sessions, I made some <a href="https://youtu.be/JL94DAu3NZI" >Cantonese comprehensible input videos</a> to facilitate my students' learning.</p></div>
