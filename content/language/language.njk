Video diary
</p>
<p>
    I was doing a journaling exercise, and the idea suddenly occured to me that I can shoot a video of me talking about my day in Spanish. 
</p><p>
So that's what I did. I shot a 7 minute video, using different corners of my bedroom, playing with different lighting. It turned out quite lovely. Watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/p1ngKadnOg4">here.</a>

    <p>Spanish blog posts</p>
    <p>I try writing in Spanish as much as I can. Therefore, sometimes when I journal in English and some topic cross my mind, I try writing them in Spanish instead.  </p>
