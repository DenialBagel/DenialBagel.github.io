Video diary
</p>
<p>
    I was doing a journaling exercise, and the idea suddenly occured to me that I can shoot a video of me talking about my day in Spanish. 
</p><p>
So that's what I did. I shot a 7 minute video, using different corners of my bedroom, playing with different lighting. It turned out quite lovely. Watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/p1ngKadnOg4">here.</a>

    <p>I try writing in Spanish as much as I can, because writing is a very good exercise to train my ability to think in Spanish. Read my entries <a href="/blog/tag/espanol/index.html">here.</a> </p>
