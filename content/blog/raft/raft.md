Sometimes i feel like im

Floating on the
bottomless sea of my own thoughts

As the glowing sphere of hot gas

disappears into the horizon

Thereâ€™s no land in sight

Only the sound of my sigh

My raft whistles
as the air leaks out

The saltiness of the water
caresses my face

As if that would ease my mind from the fact that

Im drowning
in the bottomless sea of my own thoughts
