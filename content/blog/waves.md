When I was in the ocean, faced with a giant wave, I had no choice but to dive in and take whatever it gave me.

When I saw the biggest wave I’ve ever seen in my life, I told her, “Take me high!” And I went up with the force. The next big wave, however, sucked me in and made me backflipped 10 times in the water.

When we live more intentionally, a lot of things around us resemble life in one way or the other.

Sometimes it took me to the top there I saw the vast horizon;

Sometimes it folded me in and I swirled like a sock in a washing machine.

Either way, I felt so alive. Being in the water, having brief moments where I have zero control over the movement of my body.

It was an experience beyond words. I laughed with pure joy. I felt blissfully alone in the world, and I loved every second of it.
