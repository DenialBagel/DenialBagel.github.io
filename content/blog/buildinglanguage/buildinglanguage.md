I find it so fascinating how, in the early stages of learning a language, we’re so attuned to the different ways people speak. Even when two people share the same accent, their speech can have such unique nuanced differences. Because of that, it often takes me a few conversastions to adjust to someone’s specific way of speaking. Though once it clicks, if feels like opening a floodgate in my head and suddenly, everything makes more sense. 

I love conversing with different people because I pick up the little words they commonly use. These words become building blocks for my own language development, and it's fascinating to watch this gradual build-up. It feels like being 5 years old, watching older kids play with Lego, snatching up the pieces I love, and creating something uniquely my own.
