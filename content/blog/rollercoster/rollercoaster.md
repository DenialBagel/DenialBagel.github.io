Thereâ€™s a distant memory in the back of my head, when I was at the highest point on the roller coaster track, you know the point where time stops and the only two things you can sense are the beating of your heart and stillness of the air, waiting for gravity to drag you down?

They say life is a roller coaster, which is pretty accurate not only in the sense that it has lots of ups and downs, but also plenty of moments in life, to me, resembles that particular moment of riding on a roller coaster, times when you clench your jaw, brace yourself, to get ready for when life pulls you back to reality.
