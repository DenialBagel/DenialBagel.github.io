                My name's Rachel. (YES IT'S MY REAL NAME) I was born and raised in Hong Kong. I have been working
                and
                travelling ever since I turned 18.

                I love languages. I speak four (Cantonese, English, Mandarin, Spanish) and teach three (Cantonese,
                English,
                Mandarin).
            </p>

        <p class="forthp">
                I am also a line cook. I have worked in restaurants, cafes, hotels. I have a love-hate relationship
                with
                this line of work but mostly I love what I do.

                Half of the year I am a solo backpacker. As of the making of this website I have just come back from
                an
                epic
                adventure to Central America.
