            <p>
                My name is Rachel. I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Hong Kong. I have been working
                and
                travelling ever since I turned 18.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love languages. I speak four (Cantonese, English, Mandarin, Spanish), teach three (Cantonese,
                English,
                Mandarin) and am currently learning my fifth (Portuguese). </p><p>Never have I ever thought I would become a language teacher, but here I am, sharing my passion for acquiring languages with my lovely students.</p>
                <p>Learning languages is also a big part of my everyday life. Lately, a typical day for me consists of talking to my family in Cantonese, typing in Mandarin, chatting with my friends in English, journaling in Spanish, and learning Portuguese.  </p>

                I am a U56 JR powerlifter. I started training in 2023 and took part in my first competition in August 2024.</p><p> On top of the massive increase of strength, powerlifting has had a huge impact on how I am as a person. Through training, I learned to maneuver the delicate balance between pushing myself and giving myself grace, which has been of tremendous help in every single aspects of my life.</p><p>The gains don’t just stop there. The precious community that I am now in became a huge part of my life, and I am so lucky to be a part of it.</p>

                I am also a line cook. I worked in restaurants, cafes and hotels.
</p>
<p>
                I have a love-hate relationship with this line of work but mostly I love what I do. 
            </p><p>
               The kitchen is such a unique place, there are a lot of knowledge and skills that I would not image being able to learn anywhere else. The heat,long hours, high level of stress, heavy lifting are surely not for everyone. Though now that I am out of work, I miss dearly the sense of accomplishment of filleting a fish up to standard, swearing with the guys during service, the freedom to whip up food when my stomach growls, and so much more experiences that only a kitchen can give you.
            </p>
            <p>
               In my last hotel job, I dipped my toe in the art of catering. Laying out dozens of plates at a time and cooking for hundreds of guests was the highlight of my weeks. Upon leaving the hotel job, I put the skill I learned from catering to outside of work. When I am out of work I like to cook for friends and family. When I travel, I cook for my hosts.

    I am a solo backpacker. As of the making of this website I have just come back from an epic 3-month hitchhiking adventure to Central America. </p>
    <p>This trip has been the absolute best thing I did for myself. I learned a language, step foot in stunning places, discovered so much about myself, trained myself to deal with problems alone. </p><p>Though if I had to pick one thing that made this trip so special, was how far kindness can go. The amount of kindness i received absolutely blew my mind. </p><p>From the start, i made two amazing friends who helped me tremendously in adapting to travelling in Nicaragua. I look up to their fearlessness and open-mindedness a lot. Also the locals who showed me around their town, everyone who picked me up when i hitchhike, those who welcomed me in their homes, they made me feel welcomed by their country. </p><p>Everyone i met was a bridge into a world I didn’t know about, and I experienced so much of the local way of life that i otherwise wouldn’t even have been aware of.
