        <p>My 5-year-old Cantonese student is obsessed with unicorns.</p>
<p>One of the activities I do with her often is &quot;spot the difference.&quot; Ever since I included a picture with unicorns in it, she refuses to do any spot-the-difference activities without unicorns. (If anyone knows where to find more, please let me know, I'm running out.)</p>
<p>She lives and breathes unicorns.</p>
<p>She has a million unicorn toys, and her enthusiasm to show me every single one of them is the most adorable thing ever.</p>
<p>Her favorite color is rainbow.</p>
<p>When she first answered my question &quot;What is your favorite color?&quot; she exclaimed &quot;Rainbow!&quot; with such excitement that she jumped off her chair. The mere mention of rainbows makes her the happiest little girl in the world.</p>
<p>Then, I asked her which color in the rainbow was her favorite. She smiled and told me &quot;all of it!&quot;</p>
<p>My teacher instinct told me to correct her, to explain that 'favorite' means choosing just one option, but then I stopped myself.</p>
<p>Who said it has to be that way?</p>
<p>Just like there are infinite decimal numbers between 0 and 1, there are infinite colors in the visible spectrum. The rainbow gradually shifts from green to blue, hitting every possible shade between.</p>
<p>At first, I felt melancholy thinking that one day she would realize unicorns aren't real, but then I reconsidered. Like the unicorns, magic exists within her. Just because I think unicorns aren't real doesn't mean they don't exist in her world. My thoughts don't matter, what matters is that unicorns are part of who she is.</p>
<p>Like her favorite color, may her world be filled with all the possibilities of her vibrant energy. May she let her imagination run wild like the unicorns in her sky.</p>
<p>I might be teaching these kids a language, but the things they teach me go far beyond words, beyond what any book or YouTube video could contain.</p>
<p>Let kids be kids. Not only that, let's learn from them. Childlike imagination and wonder are gifts we should cherish and protect, not correct or diminish.</p>
<p>I give unicorns and rainbows 5 stars.</p>
