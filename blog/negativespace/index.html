        <p>One plating skill I learned while working as a line cook was the use of negative space on a plate.</p>
<p>A plate full of food just does not look good. It looks overwhelming and unprofessional.</p>
<p>Funny enough, today I learned that the golden rule of negative space does not only apply in plating food. Instead, it is very relevant to our every day life.</p>
<p>One thing about me, I am very bad at letting myself relax. I always have this discomfort of doing nothing and letting myself rest. This toxic trait of mine has lead to so many burn outs and creativity blocks. I recognize it, but it is not easy to change. I continue to battle with toxic productivity every single day.</p>
<p>Today is day 1 post-operation. I woke up to a pounding headache as a side effect of the spinal anesthesia procedure. I attempted to get up from my hospital bed to get to my computer, learn some Portuguese, write on my journal, but then I gave up after a while.</p>
<p>I crawled back to bed with frustration.</p>
<p>Curling up in fetal position under the blanket, I marinated in the sea of my own thoughts. I let my mind wander, with no objective and purpose in mind.</p>
<p>And then, something amazing happened.</p>
<p>I came up with so many ideas. I cleared up some tutoring roadblocks, came up with new approaches for language learning, some more ideas for Denial Bagel, and solutions for a bunch of other little things I was faced with in life. Best part of all? My headache went away.</p>
<p>I realized the importance of negative space in my routine. I was so fixated on the concept that productivity can only mean sitting at my desk in front of my notebook or computer. Though curling up in bed eyes closed, I was able to have the most uninterrupted trains of thoughts due to the absence of stimulation. With no obstacles on the railway and traffic lights to lead my train to another direction, I was able to drive my train all the way straight to my destination.</p>
<p>Satisfied, I got out of bed, grabbed my notebook, and wrote down this observation and my new ideas before the wave of headache crept back.</p>
