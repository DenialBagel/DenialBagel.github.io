        <p class="p 1">
            Never have I ever imagined I would on eday build a website. Growing up I had never been sharp with
            technology. I never passed one single coding class, and had zero interest in anything code related.
        </p>
        <p class="p 2">
            Until...I injured myself in a backpacking trip and had to stay home and rest for a few months. (read about
            my accident here). With the newly acquired free time, the idea occured to me.

            What started as a fleeting thought stayed in the back of my head, marinated for a few days until I decided
            to give it a go. For one week I went through a 5 hour HTML and CSS tutorial, hence the making of this
            website.

            I can't thank my good friend, Walter Augustine, enough. As a developer, he generously spent time coding with
            me outside his work hours. With a 12-hour time difference between us, he patiently handled my flood of
            coding questions every time he woke up. He endured my messy code and basic questions, helped me debug, and
            shared valuable tips and tricks from his decade of full-time coding experience.
