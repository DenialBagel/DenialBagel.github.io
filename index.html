    While markets tumbled, the world economy teetered, and the remains of fallen soldiers who died in a training accident in Lithuania were returned to Dover Air Force Base on Friday, Trump ignored the economic turmoil, refused to meet with lawmakers, and skipped his planned appearance at the airbase to attend the dignified transfer of remains.

Why?

<div>To play in a golf tournament in Florida because you apparently need not make anything up anymore. Trump has decided to be so stupid, cruel, and immoral that you simply need to report the facts to paint him as a monster.</div>
